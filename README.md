"This project is a Python-based PDF document analysis tool. It extracts text, identifies key sections using PyPDF2 and sentence-transformers, then ranks and summarizes content based on a defined persona and task. Packaged with Docker for easy deployment, it provides persona-centric insights from PDFs without external network access."
